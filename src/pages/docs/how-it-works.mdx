title: How It Works
description: An overview of the Wrapt philosophy and how things actually work.
---

## The Basics
The whole idea for Wrapt started out with a goal of eliminating as much of the tedious and repetitive work that comes with 
setting up a Web API as possible, so that myself and other developers could ***focus on actually building their app and working on high value, 
business specific, features.***

To accomplish this, I put together a custom CLI called Craftsman. Craftsman is the workhorse behind Wrapt that can not 
only scaffold out an entire Web API with just a simple `yaml` or `json` file, but can also run commands that allow us 
to continue to maintain that project after it's been built. This file is *not* meant to be the source of truth for you API, but 
merely a description of how you want to start out.

In practice, this means that we can scaffold out all of the boilerplate using the CLI, so you can open up your project and 
start writing your business logic right away.

## But What is Wrapt?
Wrapt is a simple framework built on .NET that we can use to quickly scaffold out and maintain our projects. 

At the end of the day, all this really means is that ***a Wrapt project is just a .NET solution that's organized in a 
particular way so that Craftsman knows how to add all your boilerplate for you.*** That's it.
