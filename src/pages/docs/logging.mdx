## Wrapt Serilog Implementation
[Serilog](https://serilog.net/) is added by default to all Wrapt APIs for easy logging. This includes [Console](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-sinks-console) 
and [Seq](https://datalust.co/seq) sinks logging by default in `Development`. If there is enough interest and input down the road, I may add some prebuilt 
configurations for other environments, but for now, non-Development environments will need to add whatever logging you're 
interested in to their respective `appsettings` files. Regardless, some manual updates will likely be needed regardless as there are just too many options to create a whole API on top of Serilog 🙂

### Working with Seq
Wrapt sets up Seq on the default port of `5341` in the local `Development` Startup. The simplest approach for this is running a docker script, usually something along the lines of ``. For more details, please check out [the Seq documentation](https://docs.datalust.co/docs/getting-started-with-docker).
