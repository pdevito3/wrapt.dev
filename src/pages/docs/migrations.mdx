## Using Database Migrations
Wrapt projects are completely compatable with Entity Framework Database Migrations.

As usual, if you are only using one `Startup` and `appsettings` file, migrations work as they always would. If you are using multiple environments, 
migrations in Entity Framework currently require you to set the environment manually before you run your migration differentiating between the right `appsettings` file. 

If you'd like to use migrations you will need to set `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` before running `dotnet ef` to let 
the host builder locate the appropriate settings file. Here's some examples for 
[Windows](https://superuser.com/questions/949560/how-do-i-set-system-environment-variables-in-windows-10), 
[Bash](https://askubuntu.com/questions/58814/how-do-i-add-environment-variables), 
and [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables?view=powershell-7). 

If you'd like to track the feature request for an inline command in EF, the Github issue is [here](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/8695).

When running migrations, make sure your `UseInMemoryDatabase` setting is set to `false` in your appsettings. This should be the case by default on all environments that are not `Development`.

## Example
1. Make sure you have `dotnet ef` installed. To install it globally run:
  ```shell
  dotnet tool install -g dotnet-ef
  ```

2. Set your env variable (e.g. Prod) that matches the environment name in `launchsettings`:

  *Powershell*
  ```powershell
  $Env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = "Prod"
  ```

  *Bash*
  ```bash
  ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = "Prod"
  ```

3. Perform your first migration. For example:
  ```shell
  dotnet ef migrations add "InitialMigration" --project Infrastructure.Persistence --startup-project WebApi --output-dir Migrations
  ```

  Your migrations should be under the project you are running them on, so in this case `Infrastructure.Persistence`

4. To add additional migrations, you can do something like this. Again, make sure that your `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` has been set.
  ```shell
  dotnet ef migrations add "added X column to y entity" --project Infrastructure.Persistence --startup-project WebApi --output-dir Migrations
  ```

5. To push the updates to your database, you can run this:
  ```shell
  dotnet ef database update -p Infrastructure.Persistence -s WebApi
  ```

## Common Db Migration Error

If you're getting an error like the below, make sure that your connection string is set in your `appsettings.json` file and `UseInMemoryDatabase` is set to `false`.

```
Unable to resolve service for type 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Migrations.IMigrator'. This is often because no database provider has been configured for this DbContext. A provider can be configured by overriding the DbContext.OnConfiguring method or by using AddDbContext on the application service provider. If AddDbContext is used, then also ensure that your DbContext type accepts a DbContextOptions<TContext> object in its constructor and passes it to the base constructor for DbContext.
