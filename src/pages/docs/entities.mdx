## Entities <FileRequirementPill padLeft={"sm"} type={"required"} />

A list of database entities in your project. These entities are added as dbsets to your database context, so they translate 1:1 to tables in your database. 

## Entity Properties

| Name       | Required | Description                                                  | Default                          |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Name       | Yes      | The name of the entity                                       | *None*                           |
| Properties | Yes      | A list of properties assigned to your entity described in the [entity properties ](#entity-properties) section.| *None*                           |
| Plural     | No       | The plural of the entity name, if needed (e.g. `Cities` would prevent `Citys`) | Entity Name appended with an `s` |
| Lambda     | No       | The value to use in lambda expressions for this entity. | First letter of the entity name. |
| TableName  | No       | The name of the table in the database. | Defaulted to the singular `Name`. |
| Schema     | No       | The schema to use in the database. | *None*, which will equate to `dbo` in SqlServer, `public` in Postgres, or `mydb` in MySQL |

### Properties

A list of properties that can be assigned to an entity.

| Name               | Required | Description                                                  | Default                          |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Name               | Yes      | The name of the property                                     | *None*                           |
| Type               | Yes      | The data type for the property. These are *not* case sensitive and they can be set to nullable with a trailing `?`. | *None*                           |
| IsPrimaryKey       | Yes      | When true, the property will be set as the primary key for the entity. For now, only one primary key is supported, with plans to add compound key support down the road. | false                            |
| CanFilter          | No       | Will set the property to be filterable in the API endpoint when set to true. | false                            |
| CanSort            | No       | Will set the property to be filterable in the API endpoint when set to true. | false                            |
| IsRequired         | No       | When true, the property will be set as required in the database. | false<br/>*true for primary key* |
| ColumnName         | No       | The database field name for the given property. | *None* |
| CanManipulate      | No       | When set to false, you will not be able to update this property when calling the associated endpoint. When set to `false`, the property will be able to be established when using the POST endpoint, but will not be able to be updated after that. This is managed by the DTOs if you want to manually adjust this. | true<br/>*false for primary key* |
| DefaultValue       | No       | Allows you to add a default value to a property. Note that it should be entered exactly as you'd want it, so a string would be something like `"My Default Value"`, a bool might be `true`, and an int might be `0` | *None*                           |
| ForeignKeyPropName | No       | When adding an object linked by a foreign key, use `ForeignKeyPropName` to enter the name of the property that acts as the foreign key | *None*                           |

<!-- | Auditable          | No       | This will determine if an entity is auditable or not. See [Auditable Entities](#auditable-entities) for more information | false                            | -->

## Entity Example
This example would create a supplier entity with several properties. Note:
- The `SupplierId` is marked as a primary key
- We have normal and nullable primitives in the `Type` option
- We have marked the properties as sortable and filterable
- We have given a default value for `IsVip`

```yaml
Entities:
  - Name: Supplier
    Properties:
      - Name: SupplierId
        IsPrimaryKey: true
        Type: int
        CanFilter: true
        CanSort: true
      - Name: Name
        Type: string
        CanFilter: true
        CanSort: true
      - Name: EmployeeCount
        Type: int?
        CanFilter: true
        CanSort: true
      - Name: CreationDate
        Type: datetime?
        CanFilter: true
        CanSort: true
      - Name: SupplierType
        Type: int?
        CanFilter: true
        CanSort: true
      - Name: IsVip
        Type: bool?
        CanFilter: true
        CanSort: true
        DefaultValue: false
```

## Example With Foreign Key

Now let's say that we had a `Sale` entity that has a `ProductId` property that acts as a foreign key to another 'Product' entity:

```yaml
Entities:
  - Name: Sale
    Properties:
    - Name: SaleId
      IsPrimaryKey: true
      Type: int
      CanFilter: true
    - Name: ProductId
      Type: int
      CanFilter: true
    - Name: SaleDate
      Type: DateTimeOffset?
      CanFilter: true
    - Name: SaleAmount
      Type: int
      CanFilter: true
```

If we wanted to return the product in our responses, we could add an additional `Product` property of type `Product` that links to the primary key of `ProductId` in our `Product` entity:
> If possible, it is recommended that you avoid returning the foreign key object directly in an entity response like this. Instead, have your front end call each necessary endpoint or build a domain object that build this out separately.

```yaml
Entities:
  - Name: Sale
    Properties:
    - Name: SaleId
      IsPrimaryKey: true
      Type: int
      CanFilter: true
    - Name: ProductId
      Type: int
      CanFilter: true
    - Name: SaleDate
      Type: DateTimeOffset?
      CanFilter: true
    - Name: SaleAmount
      Type: int
      CanFilter: true
    - Name: Product
      Type: Product
      ForeignKeyPropName: ProductId
```

> Note that adding foreign keys will currently break the `Post` and `Update` integration tests as described in [issue #2](https://github.com/pdevito3/craftsman/issues/2).

## Composite Keys
For the time being, composite keys can not be created using Craftsman commands. With that said, you are more than welcome to scaffold out an entity with one of the keys and then 
modify the generated entity, repository, tests, etc. to accommodate that composite key.
